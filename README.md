Adventure Quest
===============

This is a really stupid "game" for Android where you do quests which involve
nothing other than waiting a while to see if you were successful.

Rules
-----

When you click the "New Quest" button a random quest is generated.  The quest
is worth 20-40% of a level and the time it takes to complete the quest is based
on that percentage and your current level.  When the time expires, you find out
if you were successful in your quest.  There is a 10% chance of failing.  If
you fail the quest, you get no reward.  If you complete the quest, however, you
will be rewarded with the allotted amount of experience.

There is no need to remain in the application while working on quests, your
character will continue without you.

Any time during a quest, you may abandon that quest if you feel it is
too difficult.  Abandoning a quest will incur an experience penalty of
20% of the experience the quest would have awarded upon success.

There is no level cap to the game, although I suppose at some point your
device will no longer be able to display your level.  The time to level
is also exponential and it will take around 185 days of questing to
reach level 60.  After level 60 the time is linear so it takes only one
additional day per level.  Anyway, good luck with that.

Features
--------

The game shouldn't use any battery while you aren't using it because it
literally does nothing at all.  This may change in the future if I add
notifications.

The quest generator is awesome.

Upcoming Features
-----------------

 * Notifications when a quest is finished
 * Pictures to go with each quest
 * Early failures
 * More data for the quest generator

Known Bugs
----------

None at the moment.
